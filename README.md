I'd like to use this space to encourage you to keep a repo of your dwelling. Keep diagrams, project quotes, garden plans, home repairs, and other related items that you, and any future owners you pass the home onto, can use and learn and measure from. File issues. Use Project kanbans to manage projects. Encourage Your family to join in. Buildings do indeed learn.

It feels dumb at first. You wont feel encouraged whatsoever, but as the years pass it becomes foundational. You gain a stronger understanding of how time passes in a way I have yet to experience elsewhere.
